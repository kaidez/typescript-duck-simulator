# GENERAL NOTES

* Is `implements` just stricter than `extends`? Is `implements` better for interface contracts? OR...

* ...use `extends` to have classes inherit from other classes and interfaces but use `implements` to have a classes "inherit" from interfaces?

* use `void` when a property doesn't have a specific type.
