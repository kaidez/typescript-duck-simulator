# GENERAL NOTES

* Is `implements` just stricter than `extends`? Is `implements` better for interface contracts? OR...

* ...use `extends` to have classes inherit from other classes and interfaces but use `implements` to have a classes "inherit" from interfaces?

* use `void` when a property doesn't have a specific type.

* TypeScript can guess types...read up on "typescript type inference" to learn more.

* read up on "function overloading".

* read up on "static members".

* in Visual Studio Code, you can either "Go to a Definition" and jump to where your code is referenced or "Peek at a Definition" and see that code from where you are in the IDE.

* TypeScript only injected code when there was class inheritance...it did the "_extends" thing. Is this still true?

* edX MIGHT have a free course <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-typescript-microsoft-dev201x-1">here</a> after April 18th, 2016.  Watch that space!!!!
